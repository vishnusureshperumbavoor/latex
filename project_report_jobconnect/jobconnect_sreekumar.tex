\chapter{Technologies used}

The technologies used to create the project are as follows:

\section{HTML}
HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. It provides a set of tags or elements that define the various components of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, and more.

HTML is a markup language, meaning it uses markup tags to define the structure and semantics of the content. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and are placed within the content of a webpage to give it meaning and structure. For example, the <h1> tag is used to define the main heading of a page, while the <p> tag is used to define paragraphs.

\section{CSS}
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful styling language used in web development to enhance the visual presentation of HTML documents. It provides a comprehensive set of rules and properties that enable developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other design aspects of a website. With CSS, designers can create engaging and attractive web pages, ensuring a consistent and professional appearance across different browsers and devices.

One of the main advantages of CSS is its ability to separate the content and structure of a web page from its visual styling. This separation allows for easy maintenance and updates, as changes can be made to the CSS file without altering the underlying HTML structure. CSS also enables efficient styling through the use of selectors, which target specific elements or groups of elements on a web page. By applying different styles to different elements, developers can achieve a customized and dynamic user interface.

\section{JavaScript}
JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used in web development to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It is a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs directly in the web browser of the user, enhancing the functionality and user experience of the web pages. JavaScript can be embedded within HTML documents or included in separate external files, providing flexibility and modularity in coding.

One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM represents the structure of an HTML document, and JavaScript allows developers to access and modify this structure, making changes to elements, styles, and content dynamically. Through DOM manipulation, JavaScript enables real-time updates, interactive forms, dynamic content loading, and other engaging user interactions.

\section{PHP}
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely used server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is a powerful and versatile language that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. PHP code is embedded within HTML documents and is executed on the server, generating dynamic content that is then sent to the user's web browser.

One of the main advantages of PHP is its ability to interact with databases. PHP supports a wide range of database management systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. This makes it easy to retrieve, store, and manipulate data from databases, enabling the creation of dynamic web pages that can handle user input, process forms, and generate personalized content.

\section{MySQL}
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for storing and managing structured data. It is a popular choice for web applications and is known for its reliability, performance, and ease of use. MySQL is compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it versatile and accessible to developers.

One of the key features of MySQL is its ability to handle large volumes of data efficiently. It provides fast and scalable database operations, allowing for quick data retrieval, storage, and modification. MySQL supports a wide range of data types, including numeric, string, date, and time, as well as more advanced types like JSON and spatial data. This flexibility enables developers to store and process diverse types of information in their applications.

\section{XAMPP}
XAMPP is a popular cross-platform software package that provides a complete web development environment. The name "XAMPP" stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MySQL (M), PHP (P), and Perl (P), which are the key components bundled within the package. It is designed to simplify the setup and configuration of a local web server, making it easy for developers to create and test web applications on their own machines.

One of the main features of XAMPP is the Apache web server, which is a widely used server software for hosting websites and serving web content. Apache provides a reliable and efficient platform for running PHP, HTML, and other web-based technologies. With XAMPP, developers can quickly set up an Apache server environment on their local machine without the need for complex configurations.
